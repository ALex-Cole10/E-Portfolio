# Holistic Reflection on Professional Growth  
*Alex Cole*  
*University of St. Thomas – Computer Science*

Looking back on my time as a computer science student, I’ve grown a lot both technically and as a person. I came into this major with an interest in technology and a competitive mindset, but I didn’t really know how deep the field could go or how much there was to learn. Over the last few years, I’ve gone from writing basic Java programs to building full-stack web applications powered by AI. I’ve learned new languages, led a team, tackled hard algorithms, and worked on projects I’m proud of. Through it all, I’ve also learned how to work with people, stay resilient, and keep pushing through challenges. My journey reflects not just growth as a developer, but as a communicator, a teammate, and a future professional ready to make an impact.

Two projects from my portfolio that best show my growth are my C++ Chess application and my senior capstone project, EZDocs. The Chess project was one I built entirely on my own. It was my first time really using C++ to build something from scrath, and it really pushed me to understand the language, the GUI with Qt, and how to handle game logic like legal piece movement, check, and checkmate. I wrote all the classes, handled the UI, and got a full working game running. It took time, but it gave me a real sense of confidence and showed me what I could do if I kept pushing.

EZDocs was a group project, and I worked with two other classmates to build a documentation tool for software engineers that uses AI to help write better documents. This one showed off my full stack skills. I built a rich text editor, which ended up being almost like Google Docs with the ability to format text and save live updates. I connected that editor to the OpenAI API so users could generate content using AI. I also helped build the PostgreSQL database and wrote all the API functions to connect the frontend to the backend. I added features like loading and saving user documents and syncing them to the editor. This project pushed my technical skills and also helped me grow. I helped design the tech stack and helped lead some meetings as well. 

Looking back, one of the biggest areas of growth for me has been in web development. I had no idea how to use frameworks like Next.js or TailwindCSS when I started, but through the EZDocs project I learned how everything connects from designing the UI and also making API requests and connecting the database. I also learned a lot about data structures and algorithms, C++, Java software engineering principles, Python, and C#. I took courses in computer architecture and information security where I learned about SQL injection, password hashing, and system vulnerabilities. One of the hardest things I had to learn was algorithm especially dynamic programming and NP-complete problems. That class was brutal. But over time, I learned that if I stuck with it and just kept coming back, things would start to click. I learned that when you're stuck, sometimes all you need is rest and get some good sleep and your brain can do amazing things. 

Working with others has been an awesome experience. In the capstone project, I had to work with two teammates who both had different personalities. I led some of our meetings and set up the initial project structure. It taught me how to communicate better and how to listen to others.  I’ve also done a bunch of group projects over the years, and those helped me realize how valuable teamwork is. You can’t succeed on a big project all by yourself. You need to work with others and communicate and that is how amazing projects get built. 

My personal values are a big part of my life. I like building things that help people. That’s one of the reasons I want to work somewhere where the product has a real impact. I think it would be amazing to work for a medical device company where your code helps save lives. Another dream would be working in sports tech, using data to help teams win or to keep athletes healthy. I’m also coaching youth soccer teams U9, U11, and U12 because I like helping kids improve and pushing them to be their best. Coaching has actually made me better at communication and leadership too. You have to explain things really clearly and be patient with the kids as it takes some time for them to learn and understand things. 

College has really pushed me to grow socially. I’ve learned how to work with people from all kinds of backgrounds and personalities. I’m not afraid to talk to anyone now. I’ve become more confident in myself and my abilities. Communication is one of the most important skills I’ve developed, and it shows up every time I have to explain a technical idea or walk someone through my code.

Right now, I’m continuing to grow by taking a data structures and algorithms course in C++ online. I want to get really good at technical interviews and Leetcode problems so I’m ready for software engineering roles. I’m also building a personal project that uses machine learning to analyze soccer game footage tracking possession, passes completed, and other stats. It’s something I’m excited about because it combines soccer with coding, which are two things I am passionate about. 

In the end, my journey through this major has taught me that growth doesn’t come from doing what’s easy. It comes from struggling through the hard stuff, asking for help when needed, and staying consistent even when things don’t click right away. I’ve gained real technical skills from C++ to full-stack development and I’ve grown as a communicator, a teammate, and a person. I’m proud of the work I’ve done and excited to keep pushing forward in my career.
